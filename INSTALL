# Compilation #
Be sure to compile with multi byte strings instead of unicode strings. Good
luck...

# Installation #
== Installation ==
  * Navigate to your vim installation (default: C:\program files\vim\vim72) 
  * Find the file named "vimrun.exe" in your vim folder. 
  * Rename this file to "vimrun.exe.bak"
  * Download the VimShell vimrun.exe and place it where the old vimrun.exe used to be
  * In that same folder, create a file called "shell.txt" and fill it as detailed in the next section.

== shell.txt == This file should consist of 2 lines, the first line containing
the command that will be executed when parameters are given (i.e. when you
type `:!echo bla` in Vim. The second line will contain the command that is
executed when you wish to silently execute a command. The third line will
contain the command that will be executed when no parameters are given (i.e.
when you type `:!` in Vim). 

An example shell.txt file (the one I use)
{{{
"C:\Program files\PuttyCyg\putty.exe" -cygterm "bash -i -c '#QQQQ#;read;'"
"C:\Program files\PuttyCyg\putty.exe" -cygterm "bash -c '#QQQQ#'"
"C:\Program files\PuttyCyg\putty.exe" -cygterm -
}}}
The #QQQQ# part will be replaced by the (one double quote escaped) arguments.
The "read" part is necessary because otherwise bash will exit right after
executing the command leaving you no time to read it.
